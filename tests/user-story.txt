To answer your question about the simple-wallet-test folder:

What is the simple-wallet-test folder for?
This folder is not a standard part of Anchor, Solana, or most JavaScript/TypeScript/React projects.
Based on its name, it likely contains code (scripts, tests, or maybe a small app) for testing a "simple wallet"—perhaps some scripts to interact with wallets, test wallet functionality, or demo wallet usage.
It is probably independent from your main project logic, smart contracts, and frontend app, unless you have specifically imported or referenced it elsewhere.
Can you delete it?
If you are not using any code from simple-wallet-test in your main project (programs, frontend, or tests), deleting it will NOT break your main project.
If you are using scripts, helper functions, or importing code from this folder anywhere else, then deleting it may break those specific features or tests.
If you are unsure, you can search your codebase for simple-wallet-test to see if it is referenced anywhere.
How to check if it's safe to delete
Search for references:
Look for any import statements or usage of simple-wallet-test in your project.
If there are no references, it is safe to delete.
Check its contents:
If it contains only sample scripts, experiments, or old code, and you don't need them, it is safe to delete.
Summary
simple-wallet-test is likely a sample/test folder and not essential to your main project.
Deleting it will not affect your core project unless you are using code from it.
If in doubt, back it up before deleting.
If you want, I can check the contents of simple-wallet-test for you to confirm exactly what it does. Would you like me to do that?

Now, I need a cart for end user on the front,  after user scan and  select a product, which be listed in a cart list, A cart list should be with Serial Number，product name, product number, and product price, right side  should remove product, at the bottom of cart list: Total Price，confirm to buy, after this go to payments,then user go to phantom, pay it, the shopping process is finished. 

Here’s how you can implement a user cart and checkout flow in your frontend (React/Next.js, with Phantom wallet for payment):

1. Cart UI/UX Requirements Recap
When a user scans/selects a product, it’s added to a cart list.
The cart list should display:
Serial Number (index)
Product Name
Product Number (quantity)
Product Price
Remove button (right side)
At the bottom:
Total Price
"Confirm to Buy" button
After confirming, go to payment:
User pays via Phantom wallet
Shopping process completes
2. Recommended Component Structure
CartContext (global state for cart)
CartList (shows the list, total, and confirm button)
CartItem (single row with remove button)
Payment logic (integrates with Phantom wallet and Anchor)
3. Example Implementation (React/TypeScript)
CartContext.tsx (for global cart state)
